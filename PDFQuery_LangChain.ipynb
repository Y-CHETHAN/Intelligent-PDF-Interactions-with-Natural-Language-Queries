A \\nchatbot based conversational user interface fits into this \\nspace. The chatbot is a class of bots that have existed in \\nthe chat platforms. The user can interact with them via \\ngraphical interfaces or widgets, and the trend is in this \\ndirection. They generally provide a stateful service i.e. \\nthe application saves data of each session. On a college’s \\nwebsite, one often doesn’t know where to search for \\nsome kind of information. It becomes difficult to extract \\ninformation for a person who is not a student or \\nemployee there. The solution to these comes up with a \\ncollege inquiry chat bot, a fast, standard and \\ninformative widget to enhance college website’s user \\nexperience and provide effective information to the user.  \\nChat bots are an intelligent system being developed \\nusing artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language \\nprocessing (NLP) algorithms. It has an effective user \\ninterface and answers the queries related to \\nexamination cell, admission, academics, users’ \\nattendance and grade point average, placement cell and \\nother miscellaneous activities.  \\n \\nKeyw ords:- Artificial intelligence, chat bot, knowledge \\nbase, lemmatization, natural language processing, \\nsemantic sentence similarity, wordnet.  \\n \\nI.

The most popular example \\ntoday is the Amazon’s Alexa. Chat bots are at almost every \\nplace, one can see it at every second website they visit. A bot \\nis helpful in answering queries related to information which \\nmight be unreacha ble at that website easily. Most of the \\nwebsites avail users with chat bots to aid them to go through \\nwhat the websites facilitate. They are turning out to be our \\nvirtual assistants in everyday lives.  \\nA. Basics of chat bot  \\nA chatbot is an artificially  intell igent  creature which can \\nconverse with humans. This could be text -based, or a spoken \\nconversation (in case of voice -based queries). Chat bots are \\nbasically used for information acquisition. It can run on the \\nlocal PCs and mobile phones, though most of the time \\nit is accessed through  the internet.  It can be  compelling, \\ncaptivating and spell -bounding. It is a conversational agent \\nwhich interacts with users in a certain domain or on a \\nparticular topic with input in natural language sentences. \\nMainly a chatbot works by a user asking some question or \\ninitiating a new topic of discussion. Chat bots can be referred \\nas software agents that pretend as human entity. These are the \\nagents with AI embedded  and using  NLP they can answer to \\nuser questions. Predefined know ledge base helps develop a \\nresponse to the query.   \\nB. Chatbot for College  \\nThe need for college inquiry system arises due to various \\nreasons which include: the slow nature of college website, an \\noutsider would not know where to search for a particular \\npiece of information, difficult for the person outside college’s \\ndomain to extract information. The smart solution for all the \\ndrawbacks lends to the need of the system. The college \\ninquiry system will provide the response by summarizing the \\nquery and then out put answers, it also provides selective \\ninformation what the user wants. A college system will \\ndispense all answers relating to domains such as admission, \\nexamination cell, notice board, attendance, placement cell \\nand other miscellaneous domains.  \\nThe major  features of the chatbot are: \\n\\uf06c College admission related queries could be answered \\nthrough it.  \\n\\uf06c Viewing user profiles and retrieves attendance and \\ngrade/ pointers.  \\n\\uf06c College students can get information about \\nexaminations to be held.  \\n\\uf06c College students can fetc h particulars about placement \\nactivities.  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3531782Implementation of a Chatb ot System using AI and NLP  \\n \\nCopyright © 2018. Innovative Research Publications. All Rights Reserved  27 \\n College inquiry system will act as a fast, standard and \\ninformative widget to enhance college website’s user \\nexperience and bestow users with righteous information. \\nThe bot will analyze user’s  queries and understand users’ \\nmessage and then reply accordingly. It uses AI & NLP. This \\nway users’ time and efforts will be saved and s/he will be \\nequipped with effective answers.  \\nThe objectives of this application are:  \\n\\uf06c To analyze users queries and under stand users \\nmessage.  \\n\\uf06c To provide an answer to the query of the user very \\neffectively.  \\n\\uf06c To save the time of the user since s/he does not have to \\npersonally go to the college for inquiry.  \\n\\uf06c This system will help the student to be updated about \\nthe college activities.  \\n\\uf06c The system will reply using an effective GUI which \\nimplies that as if a real person is talking to the user.  \\n \\nII. PROPOSED SYSTEM  \\nA. Context Identification:  \\nPre-processing is applied to the input text to standardize the \\ninput as per the system’s requir ement. Based on the \\nkeywords used in the text, appropriate context is \\nrecognized.  \\nB. Personal Query Response System (Module -1): \\nUpon receiving personal queries like CGPA, attendance, \\netc., the authenticity of the user is checked through user -id \\nand password. If the user detail is invalid, an appropriate \\nresponse is sent.  \\nIf the user authenticates successfully, the input text is \\nprocessed to extract keywords. Based on the keywords, \\ninformation required by the user is understood and the \\ninformation is provided from the database.  \\nC. AIML Response System  \\n(Module -2): \\nIf the user is trying to make a normal conversation with the \\nbot, the input is mapped to an appropriate pattern in \\nArtificial Intelligence Modeling Language ( AIML) files. If \\nthe response is available, it  is sent to the user. Other data \\nprovided to the chatbot such as username, gender, etc. are \\nalso saved. If the pattern is not available in AIML files, a \\nrandom response is sent suggesting “Invalid Input”.  \\nD. Query Analysis and Response System (Module -3): \\nWhen a user wants some information pertaining to college, \\nthe response will be provided through this module.  \\nIf the input matches a pattern in the AIML files, the \\nappropriate response will be sent to the user. If the AIML \\nfiles have no entry for that particu lar query pattern, \\nkeywords are fetched from the input.  \\nAn algorithm to check sentence similarity (NLP) is \\napplied to the modified input to check its similarity with the \\nquestions of a predefined question -set, whose answers are \\navailable.  \\nIf a sentence i s retrieved with confidence> 0.5, we \\nreturn the answer of that question as the response.  \\nIf no questions map to the user input, the input is saved \\nin a log file for improvement of the system by the admin. \\nThe administrator can incorporate the answer to th at query in the knowledge base if s/he finds it convenient. Also, a \\nrandom response is sent to the user suggesting “Answer not \\navailable”.  \\nE. Context Reset:  \\nOnce the user is satisfied with the response of bot and does \\nnot wish to chat further, he/she has t he option to log out of the \\nsystem or simply exit. Once the user exits the system, all input \\nparameters are automatically reset.  \\nIII.

IMPLEMENTATION  \\nA. AIML:  \\nTo create our knowledge base for normal conversation, we \\nhave used AIML files to store the question and answers pair. \\nWhen user converses with our chat bot, the input is matched \\nto patterns listed in AIML files and correspond ing answer is \\nreturned as response.  \\n \\nThe sample AIML file structure is as:  \\n<aiml version = \"1.0.1\" encoding = \"UTF -8\"?>  \\n<category>  \\n<pattern> HELLO USERNAME</pattern>  \\n<template> Hello User!</template>  \\n</category>  \\n</aiml>  \\n \\nB. Lemmatization and POS Tagging Using  WordNet:  \\nInformation extraction from the input text was done by \\nextracting keywords. For example, “What is the current \\nplacement scenario?” contain “current”, “placement” and \\n“scenario” as the keywords. Appropriate Lemmas of the \\nkeywords were found using Lemmatization and POS tagging, \\nto group together the different inflected form of the words. \\nFor example, requiring, require and required should map to \\nrequire. WordNet from Python’s “nltk” package was used for \\nthis purpose.  \\nC. Semantic Sentence Similarity:  \\nThere are various combinations in which user can input the \\nsame query. For example,  \\nQ1: What is the notice regarding PG courses re -registration?  \\nQ2: Tell me about re -registration in PG courses in our \\ncollege.  \\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3531782Implementation of a Chatb ot System using AI and NLP  \\n \\nCopyright © 2018. Innovative Research Publications. All Rights Reserved  29 \\n Q1 and Q2 both mean the same thing (same sens e). Also, \\nthere will be many more combinations for this same query \\nand finding all such combinations will not be feasible. The \\nscalability and performance of the system will also get \\naffected. To overcome this problem, similarity is found out \\nbetween the u ser input and the queries present in the \\navailable question set (whose answers are available with the \\nsystem). The query which matches with the input with \\nmaximum score gets selected (if greater than threshold) and \\nthe appropriate response is returned.  \\nSimilarity score for two sentences is calculated by \\naveraging the similarity of the individual keywords of those \\nsentences. Each keyword of the first sentence is matched \\nwith every keyword of the second sentence to find the word \\nwith maximum similarity to it . Then the similarity score of \\nindividual words are averaged to represent the sentence \\nsimilarity.  \\nTo find the word similarity - Path Similarity and \\nWu-Palmer (WUP) Similarity is used.  \\nPath similarity computes shortest number of edges \\nfrom one word sense to  another word sense, assuming a \\nhierarchical structure like WordNet. In general, word senses \\nwhich have a longer path distance are less similar than those \\nwith a very short path distance, e.g. man, dog versus man, \\ntree (expectation is that man is more simi lar to dog than it is \\nto tree). The Wu -Palmer metric weights the edges based on \\ndistance in the hierarchy.  \\nD. Log File:  \\nWe have maintained a log file which stores the inputs which \\nthe chatbot was not able to answer. Admin can see the log \\nand add the response  of relevant sentences to the knowledge \\nbase. This would help in improvement of the chatbot \\nknowledge system i.e. the databases.  \\n \\nV. APPLICATIONS  \\n\\uf06c It enables the students to  be updated with college \\nactivities.  \\n\\uf06c It saves time  for the students as well as  teaching and \\nnon-teaching staffs.  \\n\\uf06c It is  providing  us a readily  available information \\nsource without taking any physical efforts.  \\n\\uf06c It is easily accessible and saving time and money also.  \\n \\nVI. CONCLUSIONS  \\nIt is often impossible to get all the data on a single interface \\nwithout the complications of going through multiple forms \\nand windows. The college chatbot aims to remove this \\ndifficulty by providing a common and user -friendly \\ninterface to solve queries of college students and teachers.  \\nThe purpose of a chatbot system is to simulate a \\nhuman conversation. Its architecture integrates a language \\nmodel and computational algorithm to emulate information \\nonline communication between a human and a computer \\nusing natural language.  \\nThe college student and employees ca n freely upload \\ntheir queries. The chatbot provides fast and efficient search \\nfor answers to the queries and gets the relevant links to their \\nquestion. A background research took place, which \\nincluded an overview of the conversation procedure and \\ntries to  find out the relevant keywords related to that query to provide the proper link. The database storage includes \\ninformation about questions, answers, keywords, and logs. \\nWe have also developed an interface. The interface developed \\nwill have two parts, one for users and the other for the \\nadministrator.  \\nVII. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  \\nInstead of AIML based bot, other algorithms can be \\nimplemented. We can include voice -based queries.  The users \\nwill have to  give voice input and the system will give  the text \\noutput. Al so, after successful execution  of chatbot in college \\ndomain, we can implement it  in other domains like medical, \\nforensic, sports, etc. It will be beneficial in all the \\nfields  as without spending much time, we  are accessing  the \\nrelevant information and  that too without any sorting.  \\n \\nVIII.
