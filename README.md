# Intelligent PDF Interactions with Natural Language Queries
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can answer natural language queries about the content of a PDF document. The system should be able to understand the content of the PDF and answer questions about it. The project is divided into three main parts:
1. **PDF Preprocessing**: Extracting the text from the PDF and preprocessing it to make it suitable for the next steps.
2. **Question Answering**: Answering the natural language queries about the content of the PDF.
3. **User Interface**: Providing a user interface to interact with the system.

## Features
- Extract text from PDF
- Preprocess the text
